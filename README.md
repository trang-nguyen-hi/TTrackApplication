## Overview
Time-tracker application (called TTrack) lets users record the time they spend on a set of tasks, create new task to track, and see summaries of their time records. For this assignment, I was in charge of all production steps from designing (based on a given user persona and including ideation, sketching and evaluating) to implementation.
